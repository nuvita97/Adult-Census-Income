- imblearn

### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project aims to answer these questions:

1. The impact of Education in Adult Income?
2. Who are more likely to get a high salary job?
3. Which model is the best way to predict salary range?

### Results <a name="results"></a>

For the code, please check the notebook `personal_income.ipynb`.
